Simple Basic Tweepy for Streaming API
================

A simple example using the Tweepy streaming functionallity. Tweepy needs users to set up "filter" (and it is a requirement). For example, this python application will listen to all mentions of "trump" on twitter or all streaming tweets from CNN and the New York Times. For the tweets containing that term, it will keep track of the hashtags used and present the most popular hashtags.

Getting started:
* 1. Create a twitter app on twitter.com/dev
* 2. Install tweepy
* 3. Edit streaming.py with your application's Details https://dev.twitter.com/apps (under "OAuth settings")
* 4. Run "python streaming.py"

Enjoy!
